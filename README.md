# Horiseon Website Refactor 

## Description

This project was the assignment for Module 1: HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor.

This was an **On-the-job ticket** or **feature request Challenge** to refactor a website using html and css, using an existing starter code.

The goal was to consider the given User Story, and meet the stated Acceptance Criteria as follows:

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
 
The existing code was to be refactored to achieve the above criteria while maintaining functionality, and maintaining the design as laid out in the following mock-up. Link to the application:
